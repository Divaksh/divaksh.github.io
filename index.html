    My name is Divaksh Jain and I'm a Full Stack Developer.
    I currently work from Jaipur, India. (26° 55' 19.4520'' N and 75° 46' 43.9860'' E)

    I'm a passionate and versatile individual with an entrepreneurial and "get stuff done" mindset who never says no to the challenges.

    I always aim to build something unique to solve problems confronting mankind with the help of technology.
    I never settle for good enough, always have the willingness to change for the best, so I always try to exploit new ideas to resolve real-life problems.
    I think creatively, and when It gets clubbed with my problem-solving as well as technical abilities, it brings real innovation.
